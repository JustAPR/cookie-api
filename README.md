**NOTE: This project used to be a fork but the original author deleted the repository, which automatically made me the new 'owner'. See [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility#deleting-a-public-repository) for more information about this topic. I do not wish to continue maintenance of this project myself though.**

# Notes

I got a lot of message/emails and hate about this repo. I'm not going to delete it, it's a very good project to show my skills, no matter if others can reuse it for their sneaker bot and add more competition for some. Be greatful of this kind of repo, because if you were a beginner, you would have loved it.
